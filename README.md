# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements and compares four machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes onset using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database. The study demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare for early disease detection and risk assessment.

## Problem Statement

Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions worldwide, with serious complications including cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and blindness. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and may lack accuracy. This project addresses the need for efficient, automated diabetes risk prediction using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

**Source:** Kaggle - Pima Indian Diabetes Database  
**Size:** 768 female patients from the Pima Indian tribe  
**Features:**
- Pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age
- Outcome (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates and handled missing values
2. **Zero Value Treatment:** Replaced zero values in medical features with column means
3. **Feature Scaling:** Applied StandardScaler for normalization
4. **Train-Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing with random_state=7

### Machine Learning Algorithms

Four classification algorithms were implemented and compared:

1. **Logistic Regression** - Linear probabilistic approach for binary classification
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Instance-based learning algorithm
3. **Naive Bayes (Gaussian)** - Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
4. **Decision Tree** - Tree-based interpretable classification model

## Results

### Model Performance Comparison

| Algorithm | Accuracy | Best Performance |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Decision Tree** | **79.11%** | ✓ Highest Accuracy |
| KNN | 73.33% | - |
| Logistic Regression | 73.28% | - |
| Naive Bayes | 73.18% | - |

*Note: There appears to be a discrepancy between the abstract (which states Logistic Regression had highest accuracy) and the document content (which shows Decision Tree had highest accuracy).*

### Evaluation Metrics
Each model was evaluated using:
- **Accuracy:** Overall correct prediction rate
- **Precision:** Positive predictive value
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** True positive rate
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Specificity:** True negative rate
- **ROC-AUC:** Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

### Confusion Matrix Analysis
Detailed confusion matrices were generated for all algorithms, showing:
- True Positives (TP)
- True Negatives (TN)
- False Positives (FP)
- False Negatives (FN)
